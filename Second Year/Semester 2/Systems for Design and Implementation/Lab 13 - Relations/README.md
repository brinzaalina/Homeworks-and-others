- Implement relationships between entities; the fetch type will be eager 
- There should be at least four entities (link entities, e.g., StudentDiscipline are not counted) and one repository per root aggregate (e.g., there should be no repositories for link entities); there should be at least one relationship for each of the following: many-to-many, one-to-many, one-to-one (many-to-many may be implemented with two one-to-many associations; one-to-one may be implemented with embeddable)
- Entity ids should no longer be visible in the frontend in any circumstances
- CRUD operations
- Operations on the link entity (e.g. enroll students to disciplines, assign/view/etc grades); reports/statistics
- Lists of entities should be displayed using pagination; the api should return paginated data (this one is missing from my implementation)
