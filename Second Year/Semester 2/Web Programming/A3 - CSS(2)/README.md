Develop an html+css web document that looks like the following web page: https://twitter.com/twitter. You should clone about one screen of this web page (not the whole web page) and your html document should look approximately 90% as the given web page. No interactivity should be added (e.g. javascript, :hover effects etc.) and you are not allowed to use any css or javascript library.
