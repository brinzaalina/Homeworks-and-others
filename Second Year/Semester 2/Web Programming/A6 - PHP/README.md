Write a web application for managing log reports. The log reports are registered (added) by users to a database repository. A log report has several attributes: type, severity (i.e. debug, warning, notice, error, critical etc.), a date, a user who created the log and the log itself (message text). A user must have the posibility to view log reports added by him/her, all log reports, logs of a specific type or severity (use AJAX for this). Also a user can delete his/her own log report. Log browsing should be paged - logs are displayed on pages with maximum 4 logs on a page (you should be able to go to the previous and the next page).
